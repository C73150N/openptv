OpenPTV - framework for particle tracking velocimetry
=====================================================

This is the code collection of the OpenPTV project - an effort to create
common code for different aspects of the Particle Tracking Velocimetry
method. The code is required to meet the community standards for quality, and
all code here is therefore peer reviewed.

The quality standards are decided upon open discussion on the community 
mailing-list, 

  openptv@googlegroups.com

The peer-review process happens in the open on the same mailing list.
